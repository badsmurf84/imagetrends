# imagetrends

A mock workload for a fictitious company used to learn and deliver demonstrations of AWS services. Think of this as a learning
platform that can be modified as needed to test AWS services. Some functionality is built with demonstrations in mind, so it is
by no means an example of a Production ready application. However the goal over-time, is to evolve it to be as Production ready
as possible, while demonstrating capabilities in real-world-like use-cases.

## Deployment

Open the AWS Console, Navigate to Cloud Formation, and Create a New Stack with the template.yaml file.

## Limitations

Only us-west-2 supported at this time.
